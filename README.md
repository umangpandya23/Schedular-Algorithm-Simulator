# Schedular-Algorithm-Simulator

# Features
- Visualization of the following algorithms:  
o First come, first serve (FCFS) (Non-preemptive)  
o Shortest	 Job First (SJF) (Non-preemptive)  
o Shortest	Remaining Time First (SRTF) (pre-emptive)  
o Round robin (RR) (pre-emptive)  
o Priority	Scheduling (PS) (pre-emptive)  

- Adjustable input parameters:  
o Number of processes  
o Quantum time  

# Prerequisites
- Python 2.7+  

# Future
- Host on AWS  
- Make the UI actually look good  
- Color scheme for processes
